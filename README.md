# Squigli
An online tool to create sound using twine.

## Introduction

Squigli is a NodeJS app. It's built without a front-end framework, using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Matter.js physics engine to simulate rope physics, and Socket.IO for real-time communication with the controller.

## Where to begin

The ```app.js``` file is a good place to start exploring the repository. It contains the server-side logic which enables the desktop and mobile app to communicate. Afterwards, check out the ```whip.js``` and ```whip-controller.js``` files in ```squigli/public/js``` to learn about the logic on the client endpoints.

## Running it locally

Since Squigli is a NodeJS app, you will need to install NodeJS on your system before you can run it locally. You can do so <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>. Afterwards, you can run the application on your machine through the command:

<pre>node app.js</pre>

## A note on authentication

The application uses a random ID generated by ```whip.js``` to ensure that Socket.IO communication between several clients does not overlap. This is an extremely simplistic solution meant to last till a proper login system is implemented.
